lisp-interpreter
================

A LISP Interpreter created with QBasic 4.5.


This is a personal project from 2006 in which I created this interpreter as a way to learn LISP, in which I had gained an interest at the time. The project was abandoned after QBasic was found to have a variety of limitations which made the interpreter very unweildy. It supports a very small subset of commands, but it could theoretically be easily extended. As such, it works fine for basic tasks as a proof of concept.

This project is as of now (14-06-11) being reimplemented in a new language.

16-12-20: Project was abandoned after the discovery of [Hy](http://hylang.org).
